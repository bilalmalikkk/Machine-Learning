## Introduction

Image recognition is a popular application of machine learning and deep learning. In this project, we use a shallow neural network to classify images into predefined categories. Shallow neural networks have fewer layers compared to deep neural networks, making them suitable for simpler tasks and quicker experimentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Car vs Non Car** dataset. It contains a collection of labeled images of cats and dogs. The dataset is split into a training set and a validation set. You can download the dataset from kaggle.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bilalmalikkk/image-recognition-shallow-nn.git
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Results

After training, the model achieves an accuracy of around 85% on the validation set. Keep in mind that this is a simple example using a shallow neural network. More advanced architectures and techniques can yield better results.
